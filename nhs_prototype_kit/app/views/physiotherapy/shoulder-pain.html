You can have shoulder pain because of the following:

- bad posture
- frozen shoulder - stiffness, sometimes no movement at all
- the muscles and tendons around your shoulder aren’t working properly (rotator cuff disorder)
-  shoulder is unstable and moves more than it should (hypermobility)
- the joint at the top of the shoulder isn’t working properly (acromioclavicular joint disorder)
- osteoporosis
- broken or fractured upper arm bone or collarbone

  <p>If you’ve injured your shoulder you should go and see your GP.</p>

##Treating shoulder pain at home

There are things you can do at home to reduce swelling and ease the pain:

- use ice packs (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel will work)
- take anti-inflammatories, like ibuprofen
- take painkillers, like paracetamol

Try to keep the shoulder moving but avoid doing anything that makes it hurt.

If there is no improvement after a couple of weeks, you might want to get
further help.

##Physiotherapy

You can get physiotherapy on the NHS to relieve pain and stiffness and help movement.

Your GP will recommend the best treatment for you. This can include:

- physiotherapy (see above)
- medication
- injections to relieve severe pain
- surgery

Shoulder pain can be long term. Even after you get treatment symptoms might continue.
