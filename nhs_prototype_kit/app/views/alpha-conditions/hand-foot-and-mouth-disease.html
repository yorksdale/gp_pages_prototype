    <h1 id="hand-foot-and-mouth-disease">Hand, foot and mouth disease</h1>

<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common infection that mostly affects children under 10.</p>

<div class="notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
  <p>
  Hand, foot and mouth disease usually clears up by itself, within about a week.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="check-if-you-have-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease">Check if you have hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>

<p>The first sign of hand, foot and mouth disease can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sore throat</li>
  <li>a fever, typically 38-39C</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be a few days before the ulcers and rash appear.</p>

    <figcaption>Sores and ulcers appear in the mouth and on the tongue. These can be painful and may affect eating and drinking.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>A rash usually also appears on the hands and feet. The spots are often red before developing into a blister.</figcaption>

<p>If you’re unsure it’s hand, foot and mouth disease, look at other <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/skin-rash-children/Pages/Introduction.aspx">childhood rashes</a></p>

<h2 id="things-you-can-do-at-home-to-ease-the-symptoms">Things you can do at home to ease the symptoms</h2>

<ul>
  <li>drink fluids to avoid dehydration (avoid acidic drinks, like fruit juice)</li>
  <li>eat soft foods like soup</li>
  <li>take paracetamol  or ibuprofen can help ease a sore throat and bring down a temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>Mouth ulcer gels, sprays, and mouthwashes, might ease the blisters</p>

<p>When you buy medicines, always check they are suitable for children and give the correct dose.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-see-your-gp">When to see your GP</h2>

<p>Speak to your GP if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your child isn’t better after a week</li>
  <li>your child is dehydrated – they’re not weeing as often as usual</li>
  <li>you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms</li>
  <li>you’re pregnant and develop hand, foot and mouth disease</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-spreads-easily">Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads easily</h2>

<p>It’s best to avoid close contact with anyone with hand, foot and mouth disease.</p>

<p>Individual schools and nurseries may have their own guidance for when your child can return so it’s best to check with them.</p>

<p>Generally, keep them away from school or nursery while they are feeling unwell.  There’s no need to keep them off until the blisters have healed.</p>

<h2 id="hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-pregnancy">Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy</h2>

<p>There’s normally no risk to the pregnancy or baby.</p>

<p>However, it’s best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease.</p>

<p>There’s limited evidence that in very rare cases catching hand, foot and mouth disease during the first three months of pregnancy could lead to miscarriage – due to the fever. However, this risk is very low.</p>
